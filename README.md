This Repo consists of R and Python scripts used to analyze single cell RNA data from publicly available data stores (10x Genomics)

**Data**
Description: 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dissociated tumor cells from 7 donors were obtained from Discovery Life Sciences. Cells were labeled with TotalSeqâ„¢-B Human TBNK Cocktail (BioLegend). Each donor was CellPlexed and pooled at equal proportions. Viable cells in the pool were identified by 7AAD staining and sorted via FACS.

Gene Expression and CellPlex libraries were generated from ~33,000 cells as described in the Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1 Chemistry Dual Index) with Feature Barcode technology for Cell Surface Protein and Cell Multiplexing (CG000390 Rev B) using the Chromium X and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 to a read depth of approximately 70,000 mean reads per cell for Gene Expression and 25,000 mean reads per cell for CellPlex.
